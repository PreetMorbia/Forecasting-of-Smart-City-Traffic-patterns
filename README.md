# 🚦 Forecasting of Smart city traffic patterns 🚗

Welcome to my Traffic Analysis project, developed during my internship at **Uniconverge Technologies**, facilitated by **Upskill Campus** in collaboration with **The IoT Academy**. This project delves into the world of traffic data, aiming to uncover trends and make accurate predictions for future traffic volumes. 🌟

## 📝 Project Overview

This project harnesses a detailed dataset of traffic volumes across various junctions over a significant timeframe. Through data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling, we aim to gain valuable insights and forecast traffic patterns effectively.

### 📂 Data Processing

1. **🔍 Data Loading**: 
   - The dataset was imported using `pandas` 📊 for a preliminary review and cleaning.
   
2. **🧹 Handling Missing Values**: 
   - Identified and managed missing values to ensure data completeness.
   
3. **🛠️ Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted `Date` and `Time` from the `DateTime` column, and added `Month`, `Year`, and `DayOfWeek` 📅 for a more detailed analysis.
   - Included a column for holidays 🇮🇳 using the `holidays` library to flag special days.
   
4. **🚫 Dealing with Duplicates**:
   - Removed any duplicate entries to maintain data quality and integrity.

### 📊 Data Visualization

Using a variety of visualization tools, we explored the traffic data to identify patterns and trends:

- **📈 Traffic Volume Over Time**: 
  - A line chart to monitor traffic trends over time 📅.
  
- **📊 Average Vehicles by Junction**: 
  - Created bar charts and box plots to compare traffic volumes across junctions and analyze the impact of holidays.

### 🔮 Predictive Modeling

To forecast future traffic volumes, we employed an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network:

1. **⚖️ Data Normalization**: 
   - Normalized the `Vehicles` column to facilitate effective model training.
   
2. **📉 Feature Selection**: 
   - Selected key features like `PreviousDayVehicles` and `PreviousHourVehicles` ⏳ to train the model.
   
3. **🧠 Model Training**: 
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then trained the LSTM model.
   
4. **📈 Evaluation**: 
   - Assessed model performance and visualized historical vs. predicted traffic volumes.

### 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍: The core programming language for this project.
- **Pandas** 🐼: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly & Matplotlib** 📊: Used for creating engaging and interactive visualizations.
- **scikit-learn** 📉: Employed for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **Keras** 🤖: For building and training the LSTM model.

### 🏆 Results

The project offered meaningful insights into traffic patterns and provided a reliable model for future traffic volume predictions. This analysis can assist city planners and traffic management in optimizing traffic flow and mitigating congestion 🚦.

## ✨ Conclusion

This Traffic Analysis project illustrates the power of data science and machine learning in tackling real-world challenges. It highlights the critical role of thorough data preparation and the effectiveness of LSTM models in time series forecasting 📅.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. I hope it offers valuable insights and contributes to further advancements in traffic management and urban planning 🌟.
